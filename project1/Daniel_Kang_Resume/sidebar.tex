\cvproject{Credit Card Fraud Detection (10/2017 - 02/2018)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Data collection: This machine learning project explores the Pavsim synthetic dataset of mobile money transactions
\item Data cleaning: Removed unnecessary variables and combined multiple variables while only keeping the transfer type of transactions
\item Data analysis: Used different machine learning algorithms (random forest, logistic regression, and support vector machine) to build the model and select the proper way to improve the accuracy of the fraud detection.We improve the accuracy from 97% to 99.998% by using the random forest method.
\end{itemize}

\cvproject{Effect of Nicotine on Human Body (09/2015 - 12/2015)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Data collection: Used Python to collect nicotine data from a crime website in the United States.
\item Data cleaning: Cleaned NHANES data, removed invalid data, and collated raw data with multiple factors.
\item Data analysis and visualization: Implemented R language algorithm packages such as ggplot2 and reshape2 are used to analyze data and make visualized data graphs.
\end{itemize}

\cvproject{Regression Analysis of NBA (09/2015 - 12/2015)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Data collection: Collected the NBA results and player data of the past whole season
\item Data analysis: Used R to establish regression analysis of data, determined the determinant variables of team members'physical factors on the results, and rank them in turn.
